<p>Proteins are created via two main steps: (1) transcription and (2) translation.
    Transcription is the process of turning DNA into mRNA, using several
    transcriptional proteins such as RNA polymerase.
    Translation on the other hand, is the actual synthesis of the protein. During
    translation, the transcribed mRNA is turned into a chain of amino acids
    with the help of ribosomes (rRNA) and tRNA. The created amino acid chain is 
    refered to as a peptide. 
    Lastly the peptide is folded several times. It has now become a fully functioning
    protein.
